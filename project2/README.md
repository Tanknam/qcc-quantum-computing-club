# Project2

This coding project focuses on implementation and application of Shor's Algorithm.

## Instruction

Follow these steps to get the project up and running locally.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Tanknam/qcc-quantum-computing-club.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd project2
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv # create virtual environment
    pip install -r requirements.txt # install all dependencies
    ```

4. Open the cloned repo on VS Code and try running the notebook

5. The notebook provided is an introduction to Shor's algorithm and does not require any input from you. Instead, I would like you to try complete the following learning path on pennylane website: **[Shor's Algorithm](https://pennylane.ai/codebook/shors-algorithm)**

6. Sign-up an account on Pennylane then start coding! The solution will be provided next week.
